# Ohm's Brain at 2Am

bro, do I even have my own thoughts?

like, for real.

is anything I think actually *mine*?

or am I just a walking collage of every tweet I liked, every podcast I half-listened to, every convo I wasn't even a part of but still absorbed?

I tell myself I see the world differently.

but do I?

or is this just the illusion of individuality?

like, think about it - 

I didn't choose my name.

didn't choose the first language I spoke.

didn't choose the rules I was taught to follow before I even knew what a *rule* was.

I was just placed into a system,

handed a playbook,

and expected to make it work.

school taught me how to find 'x'

but never once made me question *why* x even mattered.

and work?

it's just school but with a paycheck.

they don't ask, *what do you want?*

they ask, *how can you be useful?*

useful.

not happy.

not fulfilled.

just *useful*.

bro, I need to lie down.

and then there's the biggest scam of all - dreams.

"follow your dreams" they say.

but what if the only dreams I've ever had

are the ones I was *allowed* to have?

like 

have I ever dreamt of something that wasn't already an option?

probably not.

so were those dreams ever really *mine*?

or just the best-looking choices from a menu someone else wrote?

bro. my head hurts.

I need water.

...but also 

if I erased all that noise.

the conditioning. the defaults. the *shoulds*.

what would I actually want?

what would ohm choose

if ohm was *truly* free?
