# notes i scribbled after watching simon sinek talk about "why"

*(this broke my brain a little. in a good way)*

- everyone knows *what* they do
- some know *how* they do it
- but almost no one knows *why* they do it

and that's where the whole game flips.

---

we spend our lives screaming what we sell

shouting what we build

pitching what we know

but the ones who move us

they whisper *why*

---

apple isn't different because they make laptops

they're different because they believe in questioning the default

they believe in thinking different

the laptop, the ipod, the phone - they're just proof of the belief

and that hits deeper than any spec sheet ever could

---

## the golden circle

why - how - what

(in that order, not the reverse)

we usually go from outside-in

but the ones who inspire - they live inside-out

---

why isn't money

money is a byproduct

"why" is a cause

a soul

a feeling you can't language your way into

your why is what gets you out of bed

when no one's clapping

when it's raining

when you're bleeding

---

## biology, not bullshit

this isn't pop psych

this is wiring

- the "what" lives in our neocortex - logic, reason, language
- the "why" lives in our limbic brain - emotion, behavior, decision-making
    
    (and the limbic brain has no language)
    

that's why you say

"I don't know. it just feels right"

that's your limbic brain talking

it speaks in gut, not grammar

---

## people don't buy what you do

they buy *why* you do it

read that again

like, really read it

---

when people believe what you believe

they show up for themselves

not for you

MLK didn't say

"I have a 7-step policy deck"

he said

"I have a dream"

and 250,000 people showed up in the August sun

no tweets

no flyers

just belief passed from soul to soul

---

## the ones who lead

they don't just have followers

they awaken something buried in the people

they say what the rest of us have been silently feeling

they name the unnamed ache

and suddenly

people are willing to crash 5 times before dinner

just like the Wright brothers

who built a plane with zero degrees, no funding - just belief

---

## the law of diffusion of innovation

- 2.5% - innovators
- 13.5% - early adopters
- 34% - early majority
- 34% - late majority
- 16% - laggards

mass adoption doesn't happen until you tip past 15 to 18 percent

that's the chasm

your job isn't to convince everyone

your job is to find the ones who already believe what you believe

---

## failures aren't about tech or talent

TiVo had all the right parts

money

market

smart people

but they only sold features

meanwhile, Apple made you feel like a rebel with a purpose

and MLK made you feel like justice had a heartbeat

---

## final punch to the gut

"there are leaders, and there are those who lead"

the first have titles

the second move souls

we don't follow the second because we have to

we follow them because we want to

because they remind us of what we already believe

but forgot how to say

---

so now the mirror turns to me

to you

to us

why do you do what you do

no jargon

no bullet points

just heart

because if your why is clear

the rest of us will feel it too

even if we don't have the words
